    """Extension class to support trunk ports.

    This class is used by Neutron's extension framework to support
    ports that trunk multiple networks. Such trunk ports belong
    to special networks used only for trunk ports. Such networks
    should have no subnets associated.
    No new resources are defined by this extension. Instead, the
    network resource's request and response messages are extended
    with an attribute 'trunked_networks' in the trunkport namespace.
    If the attribute is None, the network is not for trunk ports.
    Otherwise the attribute is a dict of the form:

    trunked_network = {
                'd22e42a2-4412-a32e-7e2e-56dcfbb243cc': 5,
                'bbe2365c-652e-2bef-62ea-b55ed23a33ac': 6,
                '6243eb53-fe6b-6ae2-cd31-b2c351fcb2de': 10 }

    that contains network_ids and the vlans used to trunk those networks.
    The dictionary can be specified in the 'Create' and 'Update' calls.
    The plugin will then trunk the specified networks according to the
    dict. If a specified vlan tag is None a value will be assigned to it.
    For provider networks the vlan tag in the 'Create' and 'Update' is
    always suppose to be None or the vlan used by the provider network.
